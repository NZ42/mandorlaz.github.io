#A Blog About Machine Learning
##and quite a few other ideas
*by Mandorlaz*

This is the blog I'll use in the future to express my ideas about innovations in the AI field. Since at the moment I'm mostly interested in Machine-Learning-based AI, the blog has been named this way to provide the greatest clarity to the reader.
This theme, however, won't be the only one to characterize the blog: my intention is to use this site as a brain-dump, allowing me to express my ideas about what interests me (mainly related to technology, philosophy, politics and books I read). A nice side-effect is, having learned English as a second language, that this blog will force me to practice for a fair amount of time english writing. In the future I may decide to maintain a separate blog, in my native language. This project is inspired by Aaron Swartz's blog, www.aaronsw.com, and in particular by his RawThought blog, which had a deep influence on me and my thought. While hardly comparable to the man Aaron was, my aim is, being probably unable to reach his creativity and originality, both to improve myself and to bring further legacy to a great soul.
